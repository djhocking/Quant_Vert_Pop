* Describe potential areas of correlation due to study design, spatial/temporal autocorrelation, and animal behavior.
* Describe sources of variation
* Simulate these data using both deterministic and stochastic processes.
* Simulate *at least* two more datasets with higher or lower variability in at least one process.
* **OR** hold the variance constant but vary the sampling effort (number or area and or frequency of sampling)
* Analyze these datasets using an appropriate statistical method
* Compare and describe the results
