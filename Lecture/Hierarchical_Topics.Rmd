Types of Models

* Occupancy
* Colonization extinction (open)

* Point Count N-Mixture Model
* Generalized N-mixture Model (open)

Approaches to accountig for detection when interested in abundance or occupancy in unmarked populations

* Multiple visits during close population time
* Temporary removal/depletion
* Double observer
* Distance sampling

* Number of study units (independent replicates)
* Any random effects and how many levels if any and what varies by the random effects
* How they accounting for imperfect detection
* What affected abundance/occupancy
* What affected detection
* How would you redesign the study to answer the same questions (same objectives)
