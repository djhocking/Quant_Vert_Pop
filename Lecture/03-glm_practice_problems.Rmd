1. Import (read in via a funtion in R, don't use the import funtion in RStudio) the ewilderae (Blue-ridge two-lined salamander) data from Great Smoky Mountains National Park.

```{r}

```

2. Run a linear model with a normal distribution to test the effect of elevation and temperature on the count (number) of salamanders.

3. Examine the residual plots and consider the assumptions of the model. What's wrong with this model? What is a better approach and why?

4. Run a GLM with a Poisson distribution on the count data as a function of elevation and temperature.

5. What are the effect sizes? Do you believe the model (look at the residuals)?

6. Add in the effect of Observer? Does that make a difference? Are any observers better than others?

7. Run a logistic regression on the presence data with the same independent data as #6.
