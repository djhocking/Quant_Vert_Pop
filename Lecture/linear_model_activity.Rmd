## Tasks

1. Generate Data in R
2. Run a linear model to see if the estimated data matches the created data
3. Read it "Sparrow.txt" data from Canvas
4. Explore the structure of the data
5. Make plots to compare sizes among species or sexes
6. Make a linear model to relate wing chord length (`wingcrd`) to mass (`wt`)
