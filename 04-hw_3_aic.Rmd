## 1. What is $AIC$ and how is it calculated

## 2. What is $AIC$ used for (i.e. what is the point of doing it)?

## 3. What is $AIC_c$?

## 4. When would you use $AIC$ vs. $AIC_c$?

## 5. What is model averaging and why would you use it?

## 6. What is $K$ in relation to $AIC$ calculations?

## 7. What is $\delta AIC$?

## 8. How do you decide what the "best" model is and how does this related to $\delta AIC$?

## 9. Does $AIC$ tell you about how good the model predicts new data? What other information would you use to understand your model and make inference from it?

## 10. What parts of this chapter and topic would you like to discuss further?
