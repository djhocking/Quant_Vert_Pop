## Pick any dataset you want and run at least 3 models and compare the AICc and the $\Delta AIC_c$ values for those models.

## Use the dipper data again and use the `marked` package vignette (on Canvas) to run the same models from lab 5. Compare the AIC values. You will likely have to install the `marked` package.
