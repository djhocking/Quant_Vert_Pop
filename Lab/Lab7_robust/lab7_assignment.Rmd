## 1. Run each of the examples from section 15.6.1 in the Gentle Introduction to MARK manual. Paste the results of each model. The data are available as `rd_simple1.inp` on Canvas.

## 2. Which model is based using AIC comparison? How do you know?

## 3. Based on the best model, is survial constant or time-varying?

## 4. Based on the best model, describe the process of emigration?

## 5. Use the `salamander_robust.inp` data. It has 4 primary periods with 4 secondary periods within each primary period. Run 3 different robust models and compare them with AIC. 

## 6. Describe the results of the best model both statistically and what it means biologically.
